# Queue Implementation Logic

Tasks are created locally and added to an in-memory Queue<TodoModel>.

The queue processes tasks sequentially in the background, attempting to upload each to Firebase via the AddTodoService.

If an upload fails (e.g., due to connectivity issues), the task is re-queued and retried after a fixed delay.

A StreamController notifies listeners of any queue updates.

The BLoC merges local queued tasks and remote Firebase tasks into a single list, ensuring the UI is always up to date.
